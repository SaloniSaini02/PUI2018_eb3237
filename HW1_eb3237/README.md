# HW-1

This repository demonstrates the work that I did for HW-1

It also explains how I linked my Github account and my local machine (ADRF environment).

I first created repository on my Github account called HW1_eb3237
This was more convenient for me. 
Then I cloned it to my local machine and continued working in it. 
I created subfolder named "screenshots" in the folder "HW1_eb3237" and uploaded two screenshots there. 
Then I modified README.md file and added my screenshots using the code below.
Finally,I commited these changes to my Github. 

So now this file shows what I  did to set up my enviroment 
TS helped me.    


This is the screenshot for my bashrc
