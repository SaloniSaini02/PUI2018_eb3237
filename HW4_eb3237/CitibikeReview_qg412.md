# Assignment 1 of Homework 5

Hi Evgeniya! Here's my review :) Don't think we have met before, hope to say hi to you in person next time! 

# Summary of tasks for this assignment: 

1) verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly
2) verify that the data supports the project
3) choose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked.
4) Write your comments, suggestions, and suggested an appropriate statistical test, motivating your test choice, in a markdown named CitibikeReview_<netID>.md. Suggest variations on the question, if you think it may be made more interesting.
Submit a pull request to the original repository to share your markdown.

# qg412's review:
**1) On the formulation of the Null ($H_0$) and Alternative Hypothesis ($H_A$)**

The given $H_0$: _The average trip time of men biking on weekdays is the same or lower than the average trip time of women biking on weekdays_

The given $H_A$: _The average trip time of men biking on weekdays is more than the average trip time of women biking on weekdays_

Comments: I think this is an interesting hypothesis- as a woman myself, I think there might be more factors inhibiting my willingness and ultimately, frequency and duration of cycling. For example, I don't want to cycle when I am wearing dress or skirt out of fear of my "modesty", something which men are not subjected to. It would be thus be interesting to see whether the analysis showed that men tend to cycle longer than women. 

Suggestions for improvements:   

- I think your null and alternative hypothesis has met the requirements of being mathematicaly testable and time specified. One thing that you might want to consider is specifying the geographical constraint, and modifying it to:

$H_0$: The average trip time of men biking on weekdays in _New York City_ is the same or lower than the average trip time of women biking on weekdays in _New York City_. 

$H_A$: The average trip time of men biking on weekdays in _New York City_ is more than the average trip time of women biking on weekdays in _New York City_.

- It would be nice to state the null and alternative hypothesis in mathematical sense, for example:

$H_0$: $\frac{W{\mathrm{weekend}}}{W{\mathrm{total}}} <= \frac{M{\mathrm{weekend}}}{M_{\mathrm{total}}}$

$H_A$:

- I think you can determine and state the significance level together with the hypothesis statements, for example "at a significance level of p=0.05". Rationale: Prof Bianco mentioned in lecture that it is very important to set the significance level at the outset, if not we risk being accused of setting the p-value at the end of analysis which is statistically morally wrong.
